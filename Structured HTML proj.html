                My name is <b>Godwin Marvellous</b>, currently a student of the <b>Lagos State University</b> pursuing my degree in computer science. <br>
            I am hoping that with the skills I learn from the Welup Bootcamp, and the certificate I would be getting, in addition with my <br>
            soon to come university degree, I can at least gain some grounds in the world computer science.
